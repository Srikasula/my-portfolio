# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Full Stack Chatbot

This is a full stack AI chatbot project built using **Python Flask**, **HTML/JavaScript**, and **OpenAI's GPT API**. The chatbot allows users to input a message through a web interface and receive intelligent, AI-generated responses in real time.

## ðŸ“Œ What I Built

 I developed and deployed:

- A **Flask-based backend** that connects to OpenAI's GPT API
- A **JavaScript + HTML frontend** to interact with users
- A full stack integration using **fetch() API** to send/receive messages
- A **live backend deployment on Render**
- A **project screenshot PDF** showcasing working UI, backend logs, and deployment status
